    "text": "1.2 Jupyter notebook\n\n1.2.1 Introduction\nJupyter notebook is an interactive platform, where you can write code and text, and make visualizations. You can access Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator, or directly open the Jupyter Notebook application itself. It should automatically open up in your default browser. The figure below shows a Jupyter Notebook opened with Google Chrome. This page is called the landing page of the notebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new notebook, click on the New button and select the Python 3 option. You should see a blank notebook as in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Writing and executing code\nCode cell: By default, a cell is of type Code, i.e., for typing code, as seen as the default choice in the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Try typing a line of python code (say, 2+3) in an empty code cell and execute it by pressing Shift+Enter. This should execute the code, and create an new code cell. Pressing Ctlr+Enter for Windows (or Cmd+Enter for Mac) will execute the code without creating a new cell.\nCommenting code in a code cell: Comments should be made while writing the code to explain the purpose of the code or a brief explanation of the tasks being performed by the code. A comment can be added in a code cell by preceding it with a # sign. For example, see the comment in the code below.\nWriting comments will help other users understand your code. It is also useful for the coder to keep track of the tasks being performed by their code.\n\n#This code adds 3 and 5\n3+5\n\n8\n\n\nMarkdown cell: Although a comment can be written in a code cell, a code cell cannot be used for writing headings/sub-headings, and is not appropriate for writing lengthy chunks of text. In such cases, change the cell type to Markdown from the dropdown menu below the Widgets tab. Use any markdown cheat sheet found online, for example, this one to format text in the markdown cells.\nGive a name to the notebook by clicking on the text, which says ‘Untitled’.\n\n\n1.2.3 Saving and loading notebooks\nSave the notebook by clicking on File, and selecting Save as, or clicking on the Save and Checkpoint icon (below the File tab). Your notebook will be saved as a file with an exptension ipynb. This file will contain all the code as well as the outputs, and can be loaded and edited by a Jupyter user. To load an existing Jupyter notebook, navigate to the folder of the notebook on the landing page, and then click on the file to open it.\n\n\n1.2.4 Rendering notebook as HTML\nWe’ll use Quarto to print the **.ipynb* file as HTML. Check the procedure for rendering a notebook as HTML here. You have several options to format the file. Here are some points to remember when using Quarto to render your notebook as HTML:\n\nThe Raw NBConvert cell type is used to render different code formats into HTML or LaTeX. This information is stored in the notebook metadata and converted appropriately. Use this cell type to put the desired formatting settings for the HTML file.\nIn the formatting settings, remember to use the setting embed-resources: true. This will ensure that the rendered HTML file is self-contained, and is not dependent on other files. This is especially important when you are sending the HTML file to someone, or uploading it somewhere. If the file is self-contained, then you can send the file by itself without having to attach the dependent files with it.\n\nOnce you have entered the desired formatting setting in the Raw NBConver cell, you are ready to render the notebook to HTML. Open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the notebook (.ipynb file), and use the command: quarto render filename.ipynb --to html."

    "text": "1.4 Python libraries\nThere are several built-in functions in python like print(), abs(), max(), sum() etc., which do not require importing any library. However, these functions will typically be insufficient for a analyzing data. Some of the popular libraries in data science and their primary purposes are as follows:\n\nNumPy: Performing numerical operations and efficiently storing numerical data.\nPandas: Reading, cleaning and manipulating data.\nMatplotlib, Seaborn: Visualizing data.\nSciPy: Performing scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization, statistical tests, etc.\nScikit-learn: Data pre-processing and machine learning, with a focus on prediction.\nStatsmodels: Developing statistical models with a focus on inference\n\nA library can be imported using the import keyword. For example, a NumPy library can be imported as:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nUsing the as keyboard, the NumPy library has been given the name np. All the functions and attributes of the library can be called using the ‘np.’ prefix. For example, let us generate a sequence of whole numbers upto 10 using the NumPy function arange():\n\nnp.arange(8)\n\narray([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is very useful in python for performing simulations (we’ll see in later chapters). The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7"

We’ll discuss these datatypes in chapter 5.\nThe data type of the object can be identified using the in-built python function type(). For example, see the following objects and their types:\n\ntype(4)\n\nint\n\n\n\ntype(4.4)\n\nfloat\n\n\n\ntype('4')\n\nstr\n\n\n\ntype(True)\n\nbool\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Practice exercise 1\nWhat is the datatype of the following objects?\n\n‘This is False’\n“This is a number”\n1000\n65.65\nFalse"

However, the value of x can be changed:\n\nx = 3\nprint(\"x =\", x)\n\nx = 3\n\n\nThus, the object x in the above code is a variable that refers to a memory location storing the constant value of 3.\n\n2.2.1 Variable names\nThere are a some rules for naming variables:\n\nA variable name must start with a letter or underscore _\nA variable name may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores only\n\nFor example, some of the valid variable names are salary, text10, _varname. Some of the invalid variable names are salary%, 10text, varname).\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. For example, the variable Varname will be different from varname.\nThere are certain reserved words in python that have some meaning, and cannot be used as variable names. These reserved words are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest coding practice: Variables should be named such that they are informative of the value they are storing. For example, suppose we wish to compute the income tax a person has to pay based on their income and tax rate. Below are two ways of naming variables to do this computation:\n\nincome = 80000\ntax_rate = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",income*tax_rate)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\n\na = 80000\nb = 0.15\nprint(\"Income tax = \",a*b)\n\nIncome tax =  12000.0\n\n\nThe former code chunk is better than the latter one as it makes the code easy to read and understand.\nPython style guide: Please refer to the python style guide for best coding practices, such as naming variables, using spaces, tabs, and styling the different components of your code.\n\n\n2.2.2 Practice exercise 2\n\n2.2.2.1 Variables or constants?\nIn the statements below, classify the objects as variables or constants?\n\nvalue = “name”\nconstant = 7\nanother_const = “variable”\nTrue_False = True\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Valid variable names?\nWhich of the following variable names are valid?\n\nvar.name\nvar9name\n_varname\nvarname*"

For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable monthly_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannnot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the python’s in-built int() function:\n\nannual_income = int(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income)\n\nmonthly income =  6666.666666666667\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built python functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to string\nstr(9)\n\n'9'\n\n\n\n#Converting string to float\nfloat(\"4.5\")\n\n4.5\n\n\n\n#Converting bool to integer\nint(True)\n\n1\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, in some cases, mathematical operators such as + and * can be applied on strings. The operator + concatenates multiple strings, while the operator * can be used to concatenate a string to itself multiple times:\n\n\"Hi\" + \" there!\"\n\n'Hi there!'\n\n\n\n\"5\" + '3'\n\n'53'\n\n\n\n\"5\"*8\n\n'55555555'"

For example, suppose a values is assigned to a variable as follows:\n\n9value = 2\n\nThe above code when executed will indicate a syntax error as it violates the rule that a variable name must not start with a number.\n\n\n2.8.2 Run-time errors\nRun-time errors occur when a code is syntactically correct, but there are other issues with the code such as:\n\nMisspelled or incorrectly capitalized variable and function names\nAttempts to perform operations (such as math operations) on data of the wrong type (ex. attempting to subtract two variables that hold string values)\nDividing by zero\nAttempts to use a type conversion function such as int on a value that can’t be converted to an int\n\nFor example, suppose a number is multipled as follws:\n\nmultiplication_result = x * 4\n\nThe above code is syntactically correct. However, it will generate an error as the variable x has not been defined as a number.\n\n\n2.8.3 Semantic errors\nSemantic errors occur when the code executes without an error being indicated by the compiler. However, it does not work as inteded by the user. For example, consider the following code of mutiplying the number 6 by 3:\n\nx = '6'\nx * 3\n\n'666'\n\n\nIf it was intended to multiply the number 6, then the variable x should have been defined as x=6 so that x has a value of type integer. However, in the above code 6 is a string type value. When a string is multiplied by an integer, say n, it concatenates with itself n times.\n\n\n2.8.4 Practice exercise 6\nSuppose we wish to compute tax using the income and the tax rate. Identify the type of error from amongst syntax error, semantic error and run-time error in the following pieces of code.\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 * Income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 x income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)\n\n\nincome = 2000\ntax = .08 ** income\nprint(\"tax on\", income, \"is:\", tax)"

This statement helps with conditional execution of code, i.e., the piece of code to be executed is selected based on certain condition(s).\n\n3.1.1 Comparison operators\nFor testing if conditions are true or false, first we need to learn the operators that can be used for comparison. For example, suppose we want to check if two objects are equal, we use the == operator:\n\n5==6\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nx = \"hi\"\ny = \"hi\"\nx==y\n\nTrue\n\n\nBelow are the python comparison operators and their meanings.\n\n\n\nPython code\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nx==y\nProduce True if … x is equal to y\n\n\nx != y\n… x is not equal to y\n\n\nx &gt; y\n… x is greater than y\n\n\nx &lt; y\n… x is less than y\n\n\nx &gt;= y\n… x is greater than or equal to y\n\n\nx &lt;= y\n… x is less than or equal to y\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Logical operators\nSometimes we may need to check multiple conditions simultaneously. The logical operator and is used to check if all the conditions are true, while the logical operator or is used to check if either of the conditons is true.\n\n#Checking if both the conditions are true using 'and'\n5==5 and 67==68\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n#Checking if either condition is true using 'or'\nx = 6; y = 90\nx&lt;0 or y&gt;50\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 if-elif-else statement\nThe if-elif-else statements can check several conditions, and execute the code corresponding to the condition that is true. Note that there can be as many elif statements as required.\nSyntax: Python uses indentation to identify the code to be executed if a condition is true. All the code indented within a condition is executed if the condition is true.\nExample: Input an integer. Print whether it is positive or negative.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")  #Input an integer\nnumber_integer = int(number)       #Convert the integer to 'int' datatype\nif number_integer&gt;0:               #Check if the integer is positive\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n\nEnter a number:-9\nNumber is negative\n\n\nIn the above code, note that anything entered by the user is taken as a string datatype by python. However, a string cannot be positive or negative. So, we converted the number input by the user to integer to check if it was positive or negative.\nThere may be multiple statements to be executed if a condition is true. See the example below.\nExample: Input a number. Print whether it is positive, negative or zero. If it is negative, print its absolute value.\n\nnumber = input(\"Enter a number:\")\nnumber_integer = int(number)\nif number_integer&gt;0:\n    print(\"Number is positive\")\nelif number_integer==0:\n    print(\"Number is zero\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is negative\")\n    print(\"Absolute value of number = \", abs(number_integer))\n\nEnter a number:0\nNumber is zero\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Practice exercise 1\nInput a number. Print whether its odd or even.\nSolution:\n\nnum = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif num%2==0:           #Checking if the number is divisible by 2\n    print(\"Number is even\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Number is odd\")\n\nEnter a number: 5\nNumber is odd\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Try-except\nIf we suspect that some lines of code may produce an error, we can put them in a try block, and if an error does occur, we can use the except block to instead execute an alternative piece of code. This way the program will not stop if an error occurs within the try block, and instead will be directed to execute the code within the except block.\nExample: Input an integer from the user. If the user inputs a valid integer, print whether it is a multiple of 3. However, if the user does not input a valid integer, print a message saying that the input is invalid.\n\nnum = input(\"Enter an integer:\")\n\n#The code lines within the 'try' block will execute as long as they run without error  \ntry:\n    #Converting the input to integer, as user input is a string\n    num_int = int(num)  \n    \n    #checking if the integer is a multiple of 3\n    if num_int%3==0:            \n        print(\"Number is a multiple of 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Number is not a multiple of 3\")\n        \n#The code lines within the 'except' block will execute only if the code lines within the 'try' block throw an error        \nexcept:\n    print(\"Input must be an integer\")\n\nEnter an integer:hi\nInput must be an integer\n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Practice exercise 2\n\n3.1.6.1 \nAsk the user to enter their exam score.

    "text": "3.2 Loops\nWith loops, a piece of code can be executed repeatedly for a fixed number of times or until a condition is satistified.\n\n3.2.1 for loop\nWith a for loop, a piece of code is executed a fixed number of times.\nWe typically use for loops with an in-built python function called range() that supports for loops. Below is its description.\nrange(): The range() function returns a sequence of evenly-spaced integer values. It is commonly used in for loops to define the sequence of elements over which the iterations are performed.\nBelow is an example where the range() function is used to create a sequence of whole numbers upto 10. Ignore the list() function in the code below, as it will be introduced later.\n\nprint(list(range(10)))\n\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n\nNote that the last element is one less than the integer specified in the range() function.\nUsing the range() function, the for loop can iterate over a sequence of numbers. See the example below.\nExample: Print the first n elements of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n&gt;2. In a fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, and the sequence starts from 0,1. The sequence is as follows:\n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,….\n\nn=int(input(\"Enter number of elements:\"))\n\n#Initializing the sequence to start from 0, 1\nn1=0;n2=1\n\n#Printing the first two numbers of the sequence\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\nfor i in range(n-2):  #Since two numbers of the sequence are already printed, n-2 numbers are required\n    \n    #Computing the next number of the sequence as the summation of the previous two numbers\n    n3 = n1+n2\n    print(n3)\n    \n    #As 'n3' is already printed, it is no longer the next number of the sequence. \n    #Thus, we move the values of the variables n1 and n2 one place to the right to compute the next number of the sequence.\n    n1 = n2\n    n2 = n3  \n    \nprint(\"These are the first\", n, \"elements of the fibonacci series\")\n\nEnter number of elements:6\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\nThese are the first 6 elements of the fibonacci series\n\n\nAs in the if-elif-else statement, the for loop uses identation to indicate the piece of code to be run repeatedly.\nNote that we have used an in-built python function\n\n\n3.2.2 while loop\nWith a while loops, a piece of code is executed repeatedly until certain condition(s) hold.\nExample: Print all the elements of the Fibonacci sequence less than n, where n is an integer input by the user, such that n&gt;2.

As an analogy, if a human is a computer program, then the mind can be considered to be a function, which has purpose of thinking, eyes can be another function, which have a purpose of seeing. These functions are called upon by the human when needed.\nSimilarly, in case of a computer program, functions are a piece of code, that perform a specific task, when called upon by the program. Instead of being defined as a function, the piece of code can also be used directly whenever it is needed in a program. However, defining a frequently-used piece of code as a function has the following benefits:\n\nIt reduces the number of lines of code, as the lines of code need to be written just once in the function definition. Thereafter, the function is called by its name, wherever needed in the program. This makes the code compact, and enhances readability.\nIt makes the process of writing code easier, as the user needs to just type the name of the function, wherever it is needed, instead of pasting lines of code.\nIt can be used in different programs, thereby saving time in writing other programs.\n\nTo put it more formally, a function is a piece of code that takes arguments (if any) as input, performs computations or tasks, and then returns a result or results."

However, sometimes we may wish to define a function that takes input(s), and performs computations on the inputs to produce an output. These input(s) are called parameter(s) of a function. When a function is called, the value(s) of these parameter(s) must be specified as argument(s) to the function.\n\n4.3.1 Function with a parameter\nLet us change the previous example to write a function that takes an integer as an input argument, and prints whether it is odd or even:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument\ndef odd_even(num):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nWe can use the function whenever we wish to find a number is odd or even. For example, if we wish to find that a number input by the user is odd or even, we can call the function with the user input as its argument.\n\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter an integer:\"))\nodd_even(number)\n\nEnter an integer:6\nEven\n\n\nNote that the above function needs an argument as per the function definition. It will produce an error if called without an argument:\n\nodd_even()\n\nTypeError: odd_even() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num'\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Function with a parameter having a default value\nTo avoid errors as above, sometimes is a good idea to assign a default value to the parameter in the function definition:\n\n#This is an example of a function definition that has an argument with a default value\ndef odd_even(num=0):           \n    if num%2==0:\n        print(\"Even\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Odd\")\n\nNow, we can call the function without an argument. The function will use the default value of the parameter specified in the function definition.\n\nodd_even()\n\nEven\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Function with multiple parameters\nA function can have as many parameters as needed. Multiple parameters/arguments are separated by commas. For example, below is a function that inputs two strings, concatenates them with a space in between, and prints the output:\n\ndef concat_string(string1, string2):\n    print(string1+' '+string2)\n\n\nconcat_string(\"Hi\", \"there\")\n\nHi there\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a function that prints prime numbers between two real numbers - a and b, where a and b are the parameters of the function. Call the function and check the output with a = 60, b = 80.\nSolution:\n\ndef prime_numbers (a,b=100):\n    num_prime_nos = 0\n    \n    #Iterating over all numbers between a and b\n    for i in range(a,b):\n        num_divisors=0\n        \n        #Checking if the ith number has any factors\n        for j in range(2, i):\n            if i%j == 0:\n                num_divisors=1;break;\n                \n        #If there are no factors, then printing and counting the number as prime        \n        if num_divisors==0:\n            print(i)\nprime_numbers(60,80)\n\n61\n67\n71\n73\n79"

The library random is used to generate random numbers such as integers, real numbers based on different probability distributions, etc.\nBelow is an example of using the randint() function of the library for generating random numbers in [a, b], where a and b are integers.\n\nimport random as rm\nrm.randint(5,10) #This will generate a random number in [5,10]\n\n7\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Practice exercise 2\nGenerate a random number between [-5,5]. Do this 10,000 times. Find the mean of all the 10,000 random numbers generated.\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\ncounter = 0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    counter = counter + rm.uniform(-5,5)\nprint(\"Mean is:\", counter/10000)\n\nMean is: 0.061433810226516616"

    "text": "5.2 List\nList is a sequence of python objects, with two key characeterisics that differentiates it from tuple: (1) the number of objects are variable, i.e., objects can be added or removed from a list, and (2) the objects are mutable, i.e., they can be changed.\nList can be defined as a sequence of python objects separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets []. For example, below is a list consisting of three integers.\n\nlist_example = [2,7,4]\n\n\n5.2.1 Adding and removing elements in a list\nWe can add elements at the end of the list using the append method. For example, we append the string ‘red’ to the list list_example below.\n\nlist_example.append('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nNote that the objects of a list or a tuple can be of different datatypes.\nAn element can be added at a specific location of the list using the insert method. For example, if we wish to insert the number 2.32 as the second element of the list list_example, we can do it as follows:\n\nlist_example.insert(1,2.32)\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 7, 4, 'red']\n\n\nFor removing an element from the list, the pop and remove methods may be used. The pop method removes an element at a particular index, while the remove method removes the element’s first occurence in the list by its value. See the examples below.\nLet us say, we need to remove the third element of the list.\n\nlist_example.pop(2)\n\n7\n\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4, 'red']\n\n\nLet us say, we need to remove the element ‘red’.\n\nlist_example.remove('red')\n\n\nlist_example\n\n[2, 2.32, 4]\n\n\n\n#If there are multiple occurences of an element in the list, the first occurence will be removed\nlist_example2 = [2,3,2,4,4]\nlist_example2.remove(2)\nlist_example2\n\n[3, 2, 4, 4]\n\n\nFor removing multiple elements in a list, either pop or remove can be used in a for loop, or a for loop can be used with a condition. See the examples below.\nLet’s say we need to remove integers less than 100 from the following list.\n\nlist_example3 = list(range(95,106))\nlist_example3\n\n[95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n#Method 1: For loop with remove\nlist_example3_filtered = list(list_example3) #\nfor element in list_example3:\n    if element&lt;100:\n        list_example3_filtered.remove(element)\nprint(list_example3_filtered)\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q1}}\\): What’s the need to define a new variable list\\_example3\\_filtered in the above code?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A1}}\\): Replace list_example3_filtered with list_example3 and identify the issue.\n\n#Method 2: Check this method after reading Section 5.2.6 on slicing a list\nlist_example3 = list(range(95,106))\n\n#Slicing a list using ':' creates a copy of the list, and so \nfor element in list_example3[:]:\n    if element&lt;100:\n        list_example3.remove(element)\nprint(list_example3)\n\n[100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n#Method 3: For loop with condition\n[element for element in list_example3 if element&gt;100]\n\n[101, 102, 103, 104, 105]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 List comprehensions\nList comprehension is a compact way to create new lists based on elements of an existing list or other objects.\nExample: Create a list that has squares of natural numbers from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225]\n\n\nExample: Create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a natural number and its square, for natural numbers ranging from 5 to 15.\n\nsqrt_natural_no_5_15 = [(x,x**2) for x in range(5,16)]\nprint(sqrt_natural_no_5_15)\n\n[(5, 25), (6, 36), (7, 49), (8, 64), (9, 81), (10, 100), (11, 121), (12, 144), (13, 169), (14, 196), (15, 225)]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Practice exercise 3\nBelow is a list consisting of responses to the question: “At what age do you think you will marry?” from students of the STAT303-1 Fall 2022 class.\n\nexp_marriage_age=['24','30','28','29','30','27','26','28','30+','26','28','30','30','30','probably never','30','25','25','30','28','30+ ','30','25','28','28','25','25','27','28','30','30','35','26','28','27','27','30','25','30','26','32','27','26','27','26','28','37','28','28','28','35','28','27','28','26','28','26','30','27','30','28','25','26','28','35','29','27','27','30','24','25','29','27','33','30','30','25','26','30','32','26','30','30','I wont','25','27','27','25','27','27','32','26','25','never','28','33','28','35','25','30','29','30','31','28','28','30','40','30','28','30','27','by 30','28','27','28','30-35','35','30','30','never','30','35','28','31','30','27','33','32','27','27','26','N/A','25','26','29','28','34','26','24','28','30','120','25','33','27','28','32','30','26','30','30','28','27','27','27','27','27','27','28','30','30','30','28','30','28','30','30','28','28','30','27','30','28','25','never','69','28','28','33','30','28','28','26','30','26','27','30','25','Never','27','27','25']\n\nUse list comprehension to:\n\n5.2.3.1 \nRemove the elements that are not integers - such as ‘probably never’, ‘30+’, etc. What is the length of the new list?\nHint: The built-in python function of the str class - isdigit() may be useful to check if the string contains only digits.\n\nexp_marriage_age_num = [x for x in exp_marriage_age if x.isdigit()==True]\nprint(\"Length of the new list = \",len(exp_marriage_age_num))\n\nLength of the new list =  181\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.2 \nCap the values greater than 80 to 80, in the clean list obtained in (1). What is the mean age when people expect to marry in the new list?\n\nexp_marriage_age_capped = [min(int(x),80) for x in exp_marriage_age_num]\nprint(\"Mean age when people expect to marry = \", sum(exp_marriage_age_capped)/len(exp_marriage_age_capped))\n\nMean age when people expect to marry =  28.955801104972377\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3.3 \nDetermine the percentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more.\n\nprint(\"Percentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more =\", str(100*sum([1 for x in exp_marriage_age_capped if x&gt;=30])/len(exp_marriage_age_capped)),\"%\")\n\nPercentage of people who expect to marry at an age of 30 or more = 37.01657458563536 %\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Concatenating lists\nAs in tuples, lists can be concatenated using the + operator:\n\nimport time as tm\n\n\nlist_example4 = [5,'hi',4] \nlist_example4 = list_example4 + [None,'7',9]\nlist_example4\n\n[5, 'hi', 4, None, '7', 9]\n\n\nFor adding elements to a list, the extend method is preferred over the + operator. This is because the + operator creates a new list, while the extend method adds elements to an existing list. Thus, the extend operator is more memory efficient.\n\nlist_example4 = [5,'hi',4]\nlist_example4.extend([None, '7', 9])\nlist_example4\n\n[5, 'hi', 4, None, '7', 9]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Sorting a list\nA list can be sorted using the sort method:\n\nlist_example5 = [6,78,9]\nlist_example5.sort(reverse=True) #the reverse argument is used to specify if the sorting is in ascending or descending order\nlist_example5\n\n[78, 9, 6]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Slicing a list\nWe may extract or update a section of the list by passing the starting index (say start) and the stopping index (say stop) as start:stop to the index operator []. This is called slicing a list. For example, see the following example.\n\nlist_example6 = [4,7,3,5,7,1,5,87,5]\n\nLet us extract a slice containing all the elements from the the 3rd position to the 7th position.\n\nlist_example6[2:7]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\nNote that while the element at the start index is included, the element with the stop index is excluded in the above slice.\nIf either the start or stop index is not mentioned, the slicing will be done from the beginning or until the end of the list, respectively.\n\nlist_example6[:7]\n\n[4, 7, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[2:]\n\n[3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\nTo slice the list relative to the end, we can use negative indices:\n\nlist_example6[-4:]\n\n[1, 5, 87, 5]\n\n\n\nlist_example6[-4:-2:]\n\n[1, 5]\n\n\nAn extra colon (‘:’) can be used to slice every ith element of a list.\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list\nlist_example6[::3]\n\n[4, 5, 5]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every 3rd element of a list from the end\nlist_example6[::-3]\n\n[5, 1, 3]\n\n\n\n#Selecting every element of a list from the end or reversing a list \nlist_example6[::-1]\n\n[5, 87, 5, 1, 7, 5, 3, 7, 4]\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7 Practice exercise 4\nStart with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:\n\n5.2.7.1 \nSet the second entry (index 1) to 17\n\nL = [8,9,10]\nL[1]=17\n\n\n\n5.2.7.2 \nAdd 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list\n\nL = L+[4,5,6]\n\n\n\n5.2.7.3 \nRemove the first entry from the list\n\nL.pop(0)\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7.4 \nSort the list\n\nL.sort()\n\n\n\n5.2.7.5 \nDouble the list (concatenate the list to itself)\n\nL=L+L\n\n\n\n5.2.7.6 \nInsert 25 at index 3\nThe final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]\n\nL.insert(3,25)\nL\n\n[4, 5, 6, 25, 10, 17, 4, 5, 6, 10, 17]\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about lists, let us try to think where it can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \n\n\nNow that we have learned about lists and tuples, let us compare them.\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Q2}}\\): A list seems to be much more flexible than tuple, and can replace a tuple almost everywhere. Then why use tuple at all?\n\\(\\color{blue}{\\text{A2}}\\): The additional flexibility of a list comes at the cost of efficiency. Some of the advatages of a tuple over a list are as follows:\n\nSince a list can be extended, space is over-allocated when creating a list. A tuple takes less storage space as compared to a list of the same length.\nTuples are not copied. If a tuple is assigned to another tuple, both tuples point to the same memory location. However, if a list is assigned to another list, a new list is created consuming the same memory space as the orignial list.\nTuples refer to their element directly, while in a list, there is an extra layer of pointers that refers to their elements. Thus it is faster to retrieve elements from a tuple.\n\nThe examples below illustrate the above advantages of a tuple.\n\n#Example showing tuples take less storage space than lists for the same elements\ntuple_ex = (1, 2, 'Obama')\nlist_ex = [1, 2, 'Obama']\nprint(\"Space taken by tuple =\",tuple_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\nprint(\"Space taken by list =\",list_ex.__sizeof__(),\" bytes\")\n\nSpace taken by tuple = 48  bytes\nSpace taken by list = 64  bytes\n\n\n\n#Examples showing that a tuples are not copied, while lists can be copied\ntuple_copy = tuple(tuple_ex)\nprint(\"Is tuple_copy same as tuple_ex?\", tuple_ex is tuple_copy)\nlist_copy = list(list_ex)\nprint(\"Is list_copy same as list_ex?\",list_ex is list_copy)\n\nIs tuple_copy same as tuple_ex? True\nIs list_copy same as list_ex? False\n\n\n\n#Examples showing tuples takes lesser time to retrieve elements\nimport time as tm\ntt = tm.time()\nlist_ex = list(range(1000000)) #List containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(list_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\ntt = tm.time()\ntuple_ex = tuple(range(1000000)) #tuple containinig whole numbers upto 1 million\na=(tuple_ex[::-2])\nprint(\"Time take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple = \", tm.time()-tt)\n\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a list =  0.03579902648925781\nTime take to retrieve every 2nd element from a tuple =  0.02684164047241211"

A dictionary is defined using the keyword dict along with curly braces, colons to separate keys and values, and commas to separate elements of a dictionary:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping'}\n\nElements of a dictionary can be retrieved by using the corresponding key.\n\ndict_example['India']\n\n'Narendra Modi'\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Adding and removing elements in a dictionary\nNew elements can be added to a dictionary by defining a key in square brackets and assiging it to a value:\n\ndict_example['Japan'] = 'Fumio Kishida'\ndict_example['Countries'] = 4\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida',\n 'Countries': 4}\n\n\nElements can be removed from the dictionary using the del method or the pop method:\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'Countries'\ndel dict_example['Countries']\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n#Removing the element having key as 'USA'\ndict_example.pop('USA')\n\n'Joe Biden'\n\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'India': 'Narendra Modi', 'China': 'Xi Jinping', 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\nNew elements can be added, and values of exisiting keys can be changed using the update method:\n\ndict_example = {'USA':'Joe Biden', 'India':'Narendra Modi', 'China':'Xi Jinping','Countries':3}\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 3}\n\n\n\ndict_example.update({'Countries':4, 'Japan':'Fumio Kishida'})\n\n\ndict_example\n\n{'USA': 'Joe Biden',\n 'India': 'Narendra Modi',\n 'China': 'Xi Jinping',\n 'Countries': 4,\n 'Japan': 'Fumio Kishida'}\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Iterating over elements of a dictionary\nThe items() attribute of a dictionary can be used to iterate over elements of a dictionary.\n\nfor key,value in dict_example.items():\n    print(\"The Head of State of\",key,\"is\",value)\n\nThe Head of State of USA is Joe Biden\nThe Head of State of India is Narendra Modi\nThe Head of State of China is Xi Jinping\nThe Head of State of Countries is 4\nThe Head of State of Japan is Fumio Kishida\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Practice exercise 5\nThe GDP per capita of USA for most years from 1960 to 2021 is given by the dictionary D given in the code cell below.\nFind:\n\nThe GDP per capita in 2015\nThe GDP per capita of 2014 is missing.

    "text": "5.4 Functions\nIf an algorithm or block of code is being used several times in a code, then it can be separately defined as a function. This makes the code more organized and readable. For example, let us define a function that prints prime numbers between a and b, and returns the number of prime numbers found.\n\n#Function definition\ndef prime_numbers (a,b=100):\n    num_prime_nos = 0\n    \n    #Iterating over all numbers between a and b\n    for i in range(a,b):\n        num_divisors=0\n        \n        #Checking if the ith number has any factors\n        for j in range(2, i):\n            if i%j == 0:\n                num_divisors=1;break;\n                \n        #If there are no factors, then printing and counting the number as prime        \n        if num_divisors==0:\n            print(i)\n            num_prime_nos = num_prime_nos+1\n            \n    #Return count of the number of prime numbers\n    return num_prime_nos\n\nIn the above function, the keyword def is used to define the function, prime_numbers is the name of the function, a and b are the arguments that the function uses to compute the output.\nLet us use the defined function to print and count the prime numbers between 40 and 60.\n\n#Printing prime numbers between 40 and 60\nnum_prime_nos_found = prime_numbers(40,60)\n\n41\n43\n47\n53\n59\n\n\n\nnum_prime_nos_found\n\n5\n\n\nIf the user calls the function without specifying the value of the argument b, then it will take the default value of 100, as mentioned in the function definition. However, for the argument a, the user will need to specify a value, as there is no value defined as a default value in the function definition.\n\n5.4.1 Global and local variables with respect to a function\nA variable defined within a function is local to that function, while a variable defined outside the function is global to that function. In case a variable with the same name is defined both outside and inside a function, it will refer to its global value outside the function and local value within the function.\nThe example below shows a variable with the name var referring to its local value when called within the function, and global value when called outside the function.\n\nvar = 5\ndef sample_function(var):    \n    print(\"Local value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'= \",var)\n\nsample_function(4)\nprint(\"Global value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' = \",var)\n\nLocal value of 'var' within 'sample_function()'=  4\nGlobal value of 'var' outside 'sample_function()' =  5\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Practice exercise 6\nThe object deck defined below corresponds to a deck of cards. Estimate the probablity that a five card hand will be a flush, as follows:\n\nWrite a function that accepts a hand of 5 cards as argument, and returns whether the hand is a flush or not.\nRandomly pull a hand of 5 cards from the deck. Call the function developed in (1) to determine if the hand is a flush.\nRepeat (2) 10,000 times.\nEstimate the probability of the hand being a flush from the results of the 10,000 simulations.\n\nYou may use the function shuffle() from the random library to shuffle the deck everytime before pulling a hand of 5 cards.\n\ndeck = [{'value':i, 'suit':c}\nfor c in ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']\nfor i in range(2,15)]\n\nSolution:\n\nimport random as rm\n\n#Function to check if a 5-card hand is a flush\ndef chck_flush(hands):  \n    \n    #Assuming that the hand is a flush, before checking the cards\n    yes_flush =1\n    \n    #Storing the suit of the first card in 'first_suit'\n    first_suit = hands[0]['suit']\n    \n    #Iterating over the remaining 4 cards of the hand\n    for j in range(1,len(hands)):\n        \n        #If the suit of any of the cards does not match the suit of the first card, the hand is not a flush\n        if first_suit!=hands[j]['suit']:\n            yes_flush = 0; \n            \n            #As soon as a card with a different suit is found, the hand is not a flush and there is no need to check other cards. So, we 'break' out of the loop\n            break;\n    return yes_flush\n\nflush=0\nfor i in range(10000):\n    \n    #Shuffling the deck\n    rm.shuffle(deck)\n    \n    #Picking out the first 5 cards of the deck as a hand and checking if they are a flush\n    #If the hand is a flush it is counted\n    flush=flush+chck_flush(deck[0:5])\n    \nprint(\"Probability of obtaining a flush=\", 100*(flush/10000),\"%\")\n\nProbability of obtaining a flush= 0.2 %"

Each of these objects have attributes and methods associated with them.\nFor example, consider a integer object named as integer_example.\n\ninteger_example = 5\n\nThe attributes and methods of this integer object can be seen by putting a . next to its name, and pressing the tab key. A dropdown menu consisting of the attributes and methods will appear as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of all attributes and methods associated with an object can be obtained with the dir() function. Ignore the ones with underscores - these are used by Python itself. The rest of them can be used to perform operations.\n\n#This code is not executed to avoid printing a long list\ndir(integer_example)\n\nFor example, an attribute of integer_example is real, which contains the real part of the number:\n\ninteger_example.real\n\n5\n\n\nA example of a method of integer_example is as_integer_ratio(), which returns a tuple containing the numerator and denominator of the integer when it is expressed as a fraction.\n\ninteger_example.as_integer_ratio()\n\n(5, 1)\n\n\nNote that attributes do not have any parenthesis after them as they are just data, and cannot accept arguments.

    "text": "6.2 Class\nA class is a template for objects. It contains the attributes and methods associated with the object of the class. As an analaogy, the class Cat will consist of characterisitcs (or attributes) shared by all cats such as breed, fur color, etc., as well as capability to perform functions (or methods) such as run, meow, etc.\nInstance: An instance is a specific realization of the object of a particular class. Continuing with the Cat analaogy of a class, a particular cat is an instance of the class Cat. Similarly, in the example above, the object integer_example is an instance of the class integer. The words object and instance are often used interchangeably.\nCreating an instance of a class is called Instantiation.\n\n6.2.1 Creating your own class\nUntil now we saw examples of in-built Python classes, such as integer, List, etc. Now, we’ll learn to create our own class that serves our purpose.\nBelow is a toy example of a class.\n\nclass ToyClass:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n    \n    def add(self):\n        return self.x + self.y\n    \n    def multiply(self):\n        return self.x*self.y\n\nWe’ll use the example above to explain the following terms:\n\nThe class statement: We use the class statement to create a class. The Python style guide recommends to use CamelCase for class names.\nThe constructor (or the __init__() method): A class typically has a method called __init__. This method is called a constructor and is automatically called when an object or instance of the class is created. The constructor initializes the attributes of the class. In the above example, the constructor accepts two values as arguments, and initializes its attributes x and y with those values.\nThe self argument: This is the first argument to every method in the class. Whenever the class refers to one of its attributes or methods, it must precede them by self. The purpose of self is to distinguish the class’s attributes and methods from other variables and functions in the program.\n\nThe class ToyClass consists of two attributes x and y, a constructor __init__(), and two methods add() and multiply().\nTo create an object or instance of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the class name with the values to be passed as argument to the constructor for initializing the object / instance.\n\ntoy_instance = ToyClass(6,12)\n\nThe x attribute of the class ToyClass can be called using the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.x\n\n6\n\n\nTo use the multiply() method of the class ToyClass, we’ll use the . operator with the object name:\n\ntoy_instance.multiply()\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Example: A class that analyzes a string\nLet us create a class that analyzes a string.\n\nclass AnalyzeString:\n    \n    #Constructor\n    def __init__(self, s):\n        s = s.lower()\n        self.words = s.split()\n    \n    #This method counts the numebr of words\n    def number_of_words(self):\n        return (len(self.words))\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words starting with the string s\n    def starts_with(self,s):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if x[:len(s)]==s])\n    \n    #This method counts the number of words of length n\n    def words_with_length(self,n):\n        return len([x for x in self.words if len(x)==n])\n    \n    #This method returns the frequency of the word w\n    def word_frequency(self,w):\n        return self.words.count(w)\n\nLet us create an instance of the class AnalyzeString() to analyze a sentence.\n\n#Defining a string\nsentence = 'This sentence in an example of a string that we will analyse using a class we have defined'\n\n\n#Creating an instance of class AnalyzeString()\nsentence_analysis = AnalyzeString(sentence)\n\n\n#The attribute 'word' contains the list of words in the sentence\nsentence_analysis.words\n\n['this',\n 'sentence',\n 'in',\n 'an',\n 'example',\n 'of',\n 'a',\n 'string',\n 'that',\n 'we',\n 'will',\n 'analyse',\n 'using',\n 'a',\n 'class',\n 'we',\n 'have',\n 'defined']\n\n\n\n#The method 'word_frequncy()' provides the frequency of a word in the sentence\nsentnce_analysis.word_frequency('we')\n\n2\n\n\n\n#The method 'starts_with()' provides the frequency of number of words starting with a particular string\nsentnce_analysis.starts_with('th')\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a class called PasswordManager. The class should have a list called old_passwords that holds all of the user’s past passwords. The last item of the list is the user’s current password. There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password and a method called set_password that sets the user’s password. The set_password method should only change the password if the attempted password is different from all the user’s past passwords. It should either print ‘Password changed successfully!’, or ‘Old password cannot be reused, try again.’ Finally, create a method called is_correct that receives a string and returns a boolean True or False depending on whether the string is equal to the current password or not.\nTo initialize the object of the class, use the list below.\nAfter defining the class:\n\nCheck the attribute old_passwords\nCheck the method get_password()\nTry re-setting the password to ‘ibiza1972’, and then check the current password.\nTry re-setting the password to ‘oktoberfest2022’, and then check the current password.\nCheck the is_correct() method\n\n\npast_passwords = ['titanic1911','ibiza1972','montecarlo799']\n\n\nclass PasswordManager:\n    def __init__(self,past_passwords):\n        self.old_passwords = past_passwords\n        \n    def get_password(self):\n        return self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]\n    \n    def set_password(self,new_password):\n        if new_password not in self.old_passwords:\n            self.old_passwords.append(new_password)\n            print(\"Password changed!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Old password cannot be reused, try again.\")\n            \n    def is_correct(self,password):\n        if password == self.old_passwords[len(self.old_passwords)-1]:\n            return True\n        return False\n\npasswd = PasswordManager(past_passwords)"

    "section": "6.3 Inheritance",
    "text": "6.3 Inheritance\nIn object-oriented programming there is a concept called inheritance where we can create a new class that builds off of another class. The new class gets all of the variables and methods of the class it is inheriting from (called the base class). It can then define additional variables and methods that are not present in the base class, and it can also override some of the methods of the base class. That is, it can rewrite them to suit its own purposes. Here is a simple example:\n\nclass Parent:\n    \n    def __init__(self, a, b):\n        self.a = a\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should study!'\n    \n    def method2(self):\n        return self.a+' does not study enough '\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    \n    def __init__(self, a,b):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        \n    def method1(self):\n        return self.a+' should play with ' + self.b\n    \n    def method3(self):\n        return self.a + ' does not play enough'\n\nNote that when inheriting from a class, we indicate the parent class in parentheses in the class statement.\nWe see that method1 is present in both the Parent and Child classes, while method2 is only present in the Parent class. Let us understand how does the Child class use the methods of the Parent class, and what happens if a method with the same name is present in both the parent and child classes.\n\np = Parent('Sam', 'John')\nc = Child('Sam','Pam')\nprint('Parent method 1: ', p.method1())\nprint('Parent method 2: ', p.method2())\nprint()\nprint('Child method 1: ', c.method1())\nprint('Child method 2: ', c.method2())\nprint('Child method 3: ', c.method3())\n\nParent method 1:  Sam should study!\nParent method 2:  Sam does not study enough \n\nChild method 1:  Sam should play with Pam\nChild method 2:  Sam does not study enough \nChild method 3:  Sam does not play enough\n\n\nWe see in the example above that the child has overridden the parent’s method1. The child has inherited the parent’s method2, so it can use it without having to define it. The child also adds some features to the parent class, namely a new variable b and a new method, method3.\n\n6.3.1 Practice exercise 2\nDefine a class that inherits the in-built Python class list, and adds a new method to the class called nunique() which returns the number of unique elements in the list.\nDefine the following list as an object of the class you created. Then:\n\nFind the number of unique elements in the object using the method nunique() of the inherited class.\nCheck if the pop() method of the parent class works to pop an element out of the object.\n\n\nlist_ex = [1,2,5,3,6,5,5,5,12]\n\n\nclass list_v2(list):\n    def nuinque(self):\n        unique_elements = []\n        for x in self:\n            if x not in unique_elements:\n                unique_elements.append(x)\n        return len(unique_elements)\n    \nlist_ex = list_v2(list_ex)\nprint(\"Number of unique elements = \", list_ex.nuinque())\nprint(\"Checking the pop() method, the popped out element is\", list_ex.pop())\n\nNumber of unique elements =  6\nChecking the pop() method, the popped out element is 12\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Practice exercise 3\nDefine a class named PasswordManagerUpdated that inherits the class PasswordManager defined in Practice exercise 1. The class PasswordManagerUpdated should have two methods, other than the constructor:\n\nThe method set_password() that sets a new password. The new password must only be accepted if it does not have any punctuations in it, and if it is not the same as one of the old passwords. If the new password is not acceptable, then one of the appropriate messages should be printed - (a) Cannot have punctuation in password, try again, or (b) Old password cannot be reused, try again.\nThe method suggest_password() that randomly sets and returns a password as a string comprising of 15 randomly chosen letters. Letters may be repeated as well.\n\n\nfrom string import punctuation\nimport random as rm\nimport string as st\nclass PasswordManager_updated(PasswordManager):\n    def __init__(self,past_passwords):\n        self.old_passwords = past_passwords.copy()\n    \n    def set_password(self,new_password):\n        if new_password not in self.old_passwords:\n            for punc in punctuation:\n                if punc in new_password:\n                    print(\"Cannot have punctuation in password, try again\")\n                    break\n            self.old_passwords.append(new_password)\n            print(\"password changed!\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Old password cannot be reused, try again.\")\n            \n    def suggest_password(self):\n        suggested_passwd = ''\n        for i in range(15):\n            suggested_passwd = suggested_passwd + st.ascii_lowercase[rm.randint(0,26)]\n        self.old_passwords.append(suggested_passwd)           \n        return suggested_passwd"

For example, consider the variable called annual_income in the code below:\n\nannual_income = \"80000\"\n\nSuppose we wish to divide annual_income by 12 to get the monthly income. We cannot use the variable annual_income directly as its datatype is a string and not a number. Thus, numerical operations cannot be performed on the variable annual_income.\nWe’ll need to convert annual_income to an integer. For that we will use the R’s in-built as.integer() function:\n\nannual_income = as.integer(annual_income)\nmonthly_income = annual_income/12\nprint(paste0(\"monthly income = \", monthly_income))\n\n[1] \"monthly income = 6666.66666666667\"\n\n\nSimilarly, datatypes can be converted from one type to another using in-built R functions as shown below:\n\n#Converting integer to character\nas.character(9)\n\n[1] \"9\"\n\n\n\n#Converting character to numeric\nas.numeric('9.4')\n\n[1] 9.4\n\n\n\n#Converting logical to integer\nas.numeric(FALSE)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nSometimes, conversion of a value may not be possible. For example, it is not possible to convert the variable greeting defined below to a number:\n\ngreeting = \"hello\"\n\nHowever, strings can be concatenated using the paste0() function:\n\npaste0(\"hello\", \" there!\")\n\n[1] \"hello there!\"\n\n\nR’s in-built readline() function can be used to accept an input from the user. For example, suppose we wish the user to input their age:\n\nage = readline(\"Enter your age:\")\n\nEnter your age:\n\n\nThe entered value is stored in the variable age and can be used for computation."

Suppose we wish to get all the elements of the \\(1^{st}\\) of the matrix:\n\nmat[1,]\n\n[1] 1 2 3\n\n\nRow and columns of the matrix can be sliced using the : operator. Suppose we want to select a sub-matrix that has elements in the first two rows and columns 2 and 3 of the matrix mat:\n\nmat[1:2,2:3]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    3\n[2,]    5    6\n\n\nElement-wise arithmetic operations can be performed between 2 matrices of the same shape.\n\nmat1&lt;-matrix(1:6,2,3)\nmat2&lt;-matrix(c(9,2,6,5,1,0),2,3)\nmat1+mat2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   10    9    6\n[2,]    4    9    6\n\n\n\nmat1-mat2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   -8   -3    4\n[2,]    0   -1    6\n\n\nSuppose we need to sum up all the rows of the matrix. We can do it using a for loop as follows:\n\nrow_sum&lt;-c(0,0)\nfor(i in 1:nrow(mat))\n{\n  for(j in 1:ncol(mat))\n  {\n    row_sum[i]&lt;-row_sum[i]+mat[i,j]\n  }\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nObserve that in the above for loop, elements of each row are added one at a time. We can add all the elements of a row simultaneously using the sum() function. This will reduce a for loop from the above code:\n\nrow_sum&lt;-c(0,0)\nfor(i in 1:nrow(mat))\n{\n  row_sum[i]&lt;-sum(mat[i,])\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nIn the above code, we sum up all the elements of the row simultaneously. However, we still need to sum up the elements of each row one at a time.\n\n10.2.1 The apply() function\nThe apply() function can used to apply a function simultaneously on all rows or columns of a matrix. Thus, this function helps avoid a for loop to iterate over all the rows and columns of the matrix. This reduces the execution time of the code since operations are performed in-parallel, instead of one-at-a-time in a for loop.\nLet us use the apply() function to sum up all the rows of the matrix mat.\n\napply(mat,1,sum)\n\n[1]  6 15\n\n\nLet us compare the time taken to sum up rows of a matrix using a for loop with the time taken using the apply() function.\n\noptions(digits.secs = 6)\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nrow_sum&lt;-c(0,0)\nfor(i in 1:nrow(mat))\n{\n  row_sum[i]&lt;-sum(mat[i,])\n}\nrow_sum\n\n[1]  6 15\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.004771471 secs\n\n\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\napply(mat,1,sum)\n\n[1]  6 15\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.001451015 secs\n\n\nObserve that the apply() function takes much lesser time to sum up all the rows of the matrix as compared to the for loop.\nRecall the earlier example where we computed year’s in which the increase in GDP per capita was more than 10%. Let us use matrices to solve the problem. We’ll also compare the time it takes using a matrix with the time it takes using for loops.\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\n\n#Let the first column of the matrix be the GDP of all the years except 1960, and the second column be the GDP of all the years except 2021.\nGDP_mat&lt;-matrix(c(G[-1],G[-length(G)]),length(G)-1,2)\n\n#The percent increase in GDP can be computed by performing computations using the 2 columns of the matrix\ninc&lt;-(GDP_mat[,1]-GDP_mat[,2])/GDP_mat[,2]\nyears&lt;-1961:2021\nyears&lt;-years[inc&gt;0.1]\nyears\n\n[1] 1973 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1984\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.003859043 secs\n\n\nWithout matrices, the time taken to perform the same computation is measured with the code below.\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nyears&lt;-c()\nfor(i in 1:(length(G)-1))\n{\n  diff = (G[i+1]-G[i])/G[i]\n  if(diff&gt;0.1){years&lt;-c(years,1960+i)}\n}\nprint(years)\n\n[1] 1973 1976 1977 1978 1979 1981 1984\n\n#print(proc.time()[3]-start_time)\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 0.007564068 secs\n\n\nObserve that matrices reduce the execution time of the code as computations are performed simultaneously, in contrast to a for loop where computations are performed one at a time.\nSometimes, the computations on rows / columns of a matrix are not straighforward and we may need to use the apply() function to apply a function on each row / column of a matrix.\nExample: Find the maximum GDP per capita of the US in each of the 5 year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2015-2020.\n\nGDP_5year&lt;-matrix(G[-c(1,length(G))],12,5,byrow = TRUE)\nGDP_max_5year&lt;-apply(GDP_5year,1,max)\n\nIn the above code, we applied the in-built function max on all the rows. Sometimes, an in-built function may not be available for the computations to be performed. In such as case, we can write our own user-defined function within the apply() function. See the example below.\nExample: Find the range (max-min) of GDP per capita of the US in each of the 5 year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2015-2020.\n\nGDP_5year&lt;-matrix(G[-c(1,length(G))],12,5,byrow = TRUE)\nGDP_range_5year&lt;-apply(GDP_5year,1,function(x) max(x)-min(x))\nGDP_range_5year\n\n [1]  761 1088 2192 3983 4261 4818 4349 6362 6989 2349 6697 7228\n\n\nIn the code above we applied a user-defined function on each row of the matrix. However, if the function has multiple lines, it may be inconvenient to write the function within the apply() function. In that case, we can define the function outside the apply() function.\nExample: Find the five year periods starting from 1961-1965, and upto 2016-2020, during which the GDP per capita decreased as compared to the previous year.\n\nGDP_inc&lt;-function(GDP_5yr)\n{\n  dec&lt;-0\n  for(i in 1:4)\n  {\n    if(GDP_5yr[i+1]&lt;GDP_5yr[i]){dec&lt;-1}\n  }\n  return(dec)\n}\n\nGDP_5year_mat&lt;-matrix(G[-c(1,length(G))],12,5,byrow = TRUE)\nyears_inc_dec&lt;-apply(GDP_5year_mat,1,GDP_inc)\nfive_year_periods&lt;-seq(1960,2015,5)\nprint(\"Five year periods in which the GDP per capita decreased are those starting from the years:\")\n\n[1] \"Five year periods in which the GDP per capita decreased are those starting from the years:\"\n\nprint(five_year_periods[years_inc_dec==1]+1)\n\n[1] 2006 2016\n\n\nThe 5 year periods during which the GDP per capita decreased as compared to the previous year are 2006-2010, and 2016-2020.\n\n\n10.2.2 Practice exercise 3\nFind the 5 year period in which the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\nSolution:\n\nfive_year_periods[which.max(apply(GDP_5year_mat,1,function(x) (max(x)-min(x))/min(x)))]+1\n\n[1] 1976\n\n\n\nprint(\"During 1976-1980 the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\")\n\n[1] \"During 1976-1980 the difference of the maximum GDP per capita and the minimum GDP per capita as a percentage of the minimum GDP per capita was the highest.\"\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Practice exercise 4\nThe object country_names is an atomic vector consisting of country names.

    "text": "10.3 Lists\nAtomic vectors and matrices are quite useful in R. However, a constraint with them is that they can only contain objects of the same datatype. For example, an atomic vector can contain all numeric objects, all character objects, or all logical objects, but not a mixture of multiple types of objects. Thus, there arises a need for a list data structure that can store objects of multiple datatypes.\nA list can be defined using the list() function. For example, consider the list below:\n\nlist_ex&lt;-list(1, \"apple\", TRUE, list(\"another list\", TRUE))\n\nThe list list_ex consists of objects of mutiple datatypes. The length of the list can be obtained using the length()function:\n\nlength(list_ex)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nA list is an ordered collection of objects. Each object of the list is associated with an index that corresponds to its order of occurrence in the list.\nA single element can be sliced from the list by specifying its index within the [[]] operator. Let us slice the \\(2^{nd}\\) element of the list list_ex:\n\nlist_ex[[2]]\n\n[1] \"apple\"\n\n\nMultiple elements can be sliced from the list by specifying the indices as an atomic vector within the [] operator. Let us slice the \\(1^{st}\\) and \\(3^{rd}\\) elements from the list list_ex:\n\nlist_ex[c(1,3)]\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nElements of a list can be named using the names() function. Let us name the elements of list_ex:\n\nnames(list_ex)&lt;-c(\"Name1\", \"second_name\", \"3rd_element\", \"Number 4\")\n\nA single element can be sliced from the list using the name of the element with the $ operator. Let us slice the element named as second_name from the list list_ex:\n\nlist_ex$second_name\n\n[1] \"apple\"\n\n\nNote that if the name of the element does not begin with a letter or has special characters such as a space, then it should be specified within single quotes after the $ operator. For example, let us slice the element named as 3rd_element from the list list_ex:\n\nlist_ex$`3rd_element`\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNames of elements of a list can also be specified while defining the list, as in the example below:\n\nlist_ex_with_names&lt;-list(movie = 'The Dark Knight', IMDB_rating = 9)\n\nA list can be converted to an atomic vector using the unlist() function. For example, let us convert the list list_ex to a vector:\n\nunlist(list_ex)\n\n         Name1    second_name    3rd_element      Number 41      Number 42 \n           \"1\"        \"apple\"         \"TRUE\" \"another list\"         \"TRUE\" \n\n\nSince a vector can contain objects of a single datatype, note that all objects have been converted to the character datatype in the vector above.\n\n10.3.1 Practice exercise 5\nDownload the dataset movies.json.

    "text": "11.1 Recursion\nRecursion is a method of solving a problem by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. This forms a loop, where every time the function is called, it calls itself again and again. However, every time the function calls itself, it checks certain condition(s) which are the stopping condition(s). When such condition(s) are true the function will stop calling itself. These conditions are called the base case of the recursive function.\nEvery recursive function must have at least two cases:\n1. Base case: This is the simplest case that can be answered directly, and the function does not call itself.\n2. Recursive case: This is a relatively more complex case that cannot be answered directly, but can be described as a smaller instance of the same problem. In this case, the function calls itself to answer the smaller problem.\nBelow is an example, where we defined a function that computes the factorial of an integer by recursion.\n\nfactorial&lt;-function(n)\n{\n  if(n==1)      #Base case\n  {\n      return(1)  \n  }        \n  return(n*factorial(n-1)) #Recursive case\n}\nfactorial(5)\n\n[1] 120\n\n\nIn the above example, the case \\(n=1\\) is the base case, where the function does not need to call itself, and returns 1. All other cases, where \\(n&gt;1\\), and \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) are recursive cases, where the function calls itself with a smaller instance of the same problem.\nA recursive function must satisfy the following conditions:\n\nThere must be a case for all valid inputs.\nThere must be a base case that makes no recursive calls.\nWhen the function makes a recursive call, it should be to a simpler instance and make forward progress towards the base case.\n\nExample: Write a recursive function that returns the \\(n^{th}\\) term of the Fibonacci sequence, where \\(n\\) is an integer, and \\(n&gt;0\\). In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the preceding two numbers, and the sequence starts from \\(0,1\\). The sequence is as follows:\n\\(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\\)\n\nfibonacci&lt;-function(n)\n{\n  if(n==0 | n==1){  #Base case\n    return(n)\n  }\n  return(fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2))  #Recursive case\n}\n#The function `fibonacci` prints the n+1th term of the fibonacci sequence when `n` is passed as an argument. Thus, we need to reduce `n` by 1 to print the nth term of the sequence. The function `nth_term` reduces `n` by 1 before passing `n` to the function `fibonacci()`.\nnth_term&lt;-function(N)\n{\n  fibonacci(N-1)\n}\nnth_term(7)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Practice exercise 1\nWrite a recursive function that computes the sum of squares of the first \\(N\\) natural numbers, where \\(N\\) is a parameter to the function.\n\nsquares&lt;-function(N)\n{\n  if(N==1)  #Base case\n  {\n    return(1)\n  }else{    #Recursive case\n    return(N**2+squares(N-1))\n  }\n}\nsquares(10)\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Practice exercise 2\nWrite a function that counts the occurrence of digit \\(k\\) in a given integer \\(n\\) using recursion.

Recursive solutions can be easy to read and understand as compared to the corresponding iterative solution.\nOne downside of recursion is that it may take more space than an iterative solution. Building up a stack of recursive calls consumes memory temporarily, and the stack is limited in size, which may become a limit on the size of the problem that the recursive implementation can solve."
